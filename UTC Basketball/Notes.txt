To find Disappearing elements like [testSelenium.content_box] can be tricky.
        Step 1: Open Chrome DevTools(f12). go to the dots span at top right then go to "more tools" > "Recorder"
        Step 2: use the recorder and click on the disappearing element on each of its aspects then review the recorder's result to f8uijind the element
            If you can't find the element necessary for a specific enough XPATH, you should get take record of the parent element and then
                Go into dev tools on the original page and find the parent element in the devtools menu
                right click the parent element and select "break on" > and then select all 3 breaks. proceed to mess with the page until you can find the specific XPATH
