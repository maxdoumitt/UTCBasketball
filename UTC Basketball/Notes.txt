To find Disappearing elements like [testSelenium.content_box] can be tricky.
        Step 1: Open Chrome DevTools(f12). go to the dots span at top right then go to "more tools" > "Recorder"
        Step 2: use the recorder and click on the disappearing element on each of its aspects then review the recorder's result to f8uijind the element
            If you can't find the element necessary for a specific enough XPATH, you should get take record of the parent element and then
                Go into dev tools on the original page and find the parent element in the devtools menu
                right click the parent element and select "break on" > and then select all 3 breaks. proceed to mess with the page until you can find the specific XPATH

Current big issue with the way this program works is that it requires the names of players and the specific way that they are refered to on the webpages in order to 
identify a lot of the data that is collected on them. as soon as a new season starts or players leave/join different teams the program in its current state will fail.
I think the way I will fix this is write a script to go into the webpages and create arrays of the players' names through simply extracting the text from the webpages
where the links will be clicked to access their data. I will most likely input the array of player names acquired from the ShotQuality webpage and plug it into the
GUI's dropdown for the user to chose which players they want.
